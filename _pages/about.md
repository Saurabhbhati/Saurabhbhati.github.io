I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student working with the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University. My research interests are unsupervised spoken term discovery and unsupervised representation learning. Recently I have been working on jointly learning the segmentation and feature representations. I received B.tech and M.tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Hyderabad, India, in 2017.
