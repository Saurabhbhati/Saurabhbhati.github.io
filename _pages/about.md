I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student working with the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University. My research interests are unsupervised spoken term discovery, unsupervised representation learning and mutlimodal learning. Recently I have been working on jointly learning the segmentation and feature representations. I received B.tech and M.tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Hyderabad, India, in 2017.
